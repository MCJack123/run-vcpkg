    description: "Specify the full SHA-1 hash of a Git commit (not a branch name, nor a tag!) that establishes which version of vcpkg needs to be used. When using vcpkg as a Git submodule, this input is *not* needed as implicitly specified by the submodule."
  vcpkgDirectory:
    default: ${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg
    required: false
    descriptions: "Specify the vcpkg's root directory. If not specified, it defaults to  <github.workspace>/vcpkg. When vcpkg is a Git submodule, specify the full path to it."

    required: false
    description: "Specifies a semicolon separated list of regular expressions that are used to identify log file paths in the workflow output. A regular expression must have a single capturing group, that is a single pair of parenthesis such as 'See also (.+.log)'.
